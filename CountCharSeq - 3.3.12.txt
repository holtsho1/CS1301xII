#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Add some code below that will count and print how many
#times the character sequence "cat" appears in mystery_string.
#For example, for the string above, it would print 2.
#
#This one is tricky! Think carefully about for-each loops,
#conditionals, and booleans. How can you track what character
#you're currently looking for? We expect you'll use a loop
#and a single big conditional, but there are other approaches
#as well. Try to stick with the topics we've covered so far.


#Add your code here!
